<p style="background-color: aqua;">Football games are games played between two teams on a usually rectangular field having goalposts or goals at each end and whose object is to 
get the ball over a goal line, into a goal, or between goalposts by running, passing, or kicking.</p>
<p style="background-color: aqua;">he origin of football can be traced back to ancient ball games played across various cultures, with evidence suggesting forms of football existed
in China as early as the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD). In China, this game was known as "cuju," described as a competitive exercise in a military 
manual. While "cuju" is considered the earliest evidence, modern football, or association football, as it's known today, has its roots in 
19th-century England. </p>
